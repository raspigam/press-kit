## Raspberry Pi demonstration event

Wednesday April 12th 2017 we demonstrated the use of the Raspberry Pi computer in the reopened Computer Lab of the Sanyang
Lower Basic School. To an audience of students, educators, experts and officials we expressed our belief in the
opportunities this device opens up for the Gambia. The event was organised and led by an ad hoc assembled team,
including Head Master mr. Ndong, IT teacher mr. Jallow and software developer Rob van den Bogaard-Braaf.

## Next steps

The team continues to work on a pilot series of Computer Lab lessons, aiming to spread knowledge of the Raspberry Pi
computer and its ecosystem (community, resources) to senior students initially, in preparation of the project's growth.

For equipping the Lab we need to add at least 10 additional Raspberry Pi setups to the two currently available.
We balance what can be sourced locally and what needs to be shipped from abroad to reduce costs and maximise
the recycling of existing material. The Pi computers need to be protected against power outages, using either one or two
central UPS units in the classroom, or a UPS add-on board per Pi. We are researching how this could get funded.

## About the project

We would like to provide IT and communication lessons for pupils of Sanyang Lower Basic School,
to give them access to knowledge and tools to create career opportunities in The Gambia.
The Raspberry Pi computer can help us to reach this goal. It also creates opportunities to
connect with other schools worldwide.

With this computer setup we would like to support the school (curricular, administrative,
infrastructural), and introduce students - the children - to computing as well as prepare
for international communication, to inspire and help them work out ideas they might
have for their careers.

## About the Raspberry Pi computer

As explained in the FAQ section of the Raspberry Pi Foundation site at https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs:

> The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card-sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It is a capable little computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word processing, browsing the internet, and playing games. It also plays high-definition video. We want to see it being used by adults and children all over the world to learn programming and digital making.
