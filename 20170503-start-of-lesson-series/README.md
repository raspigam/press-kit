# Start of lesson series for senior students

Wednesday May 3 2017 we started a lesson series on the Raspberry Pi for senior students.
Classes take place Monday and Wednesday afternoons at the Computer Lab of Sanyang Lower Basic School.

The first part of the series covers introducing the Raspberry Pi computer hardware and demonstrating a selection of software:
e.g. LibreOffice, Scratch and Sonic Pi.
