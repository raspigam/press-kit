## About the project

We would like to provide IT and communication lessons for pupils of Sanyang Lower Basic School,
to give them access to knowledge and tools to create career opportunities in The Gambia.
The Raspberry Pi computer can help us to reach this goal. It also creates opportunities to
connect with other schools worldwide.

With this computer setup we would like to support the school (curricular, administrative,
infrastructural), and introduce students - the children - to computing as well as prepare
for international communication, to inspire and help them work out ideas they might
have for their careers.

We aim to scale-up to more schools as soon as we see the concept is working and sustainable.

The project is in its initial phase.

## Current next steps

- Build documentation and press kit *(Netherlands)* ONGOING
- Discuss details on initial courses with the school *(Gambia)* DONE
- Collect or author education content and lesson plans *(Gambia and Netherlands)* IN PROGRESS
- Start initial courses to build knowledge momentum *(Gambia)* DONE
- Investigate funding options for the pilot/showcase lab; how should we collect donations, can we join a program or project? *(Netherlands and Gambia)* DONE
- Find the best internet provider and plan for the Sanyang area (current connectivity of the Computer Lab is quite unreliable) *(Gambia)* IN PROGRESS
- Find prospective partner schools for exchange and collaboration *(Netherlands)* STARTING
- Investigate cost-reduction opportunities (e.g. recycle screens/tv sets available, investigate minimal UPS setup, some cables are cheaper in EU, some in The Gambia) *(Gambia and Netherlands)* DONE FIRST ITERATION
- Prepare project proposal to authorities *(Gambia and Netherlands)* IN PROGRESS
