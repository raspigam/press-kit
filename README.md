## Events

- 2017-04-12 [Demonstration of the Raspberry Pi computer at the Sanyang Lower Basic School Computer Lab](20170412-sanyang-computer-lab-raspberrypi-demonstration)

## About the project

We would like to provide IT and communication lessons for pupils of Sanyang Lower Basic School,
to give them access to knowledge and tools to create career opportunities in The Gambia.
The Raspberry Pi computer can help us to reach this goal. It also creates opportunities to
connect with other schools worldwide.

With this computer setup we would like to support the school (curricular, administrative,
infrastructural), and introduce students - the children - to computing as well as prepare
for international communication, to inspire and help them work out ideas they might
have for their careers.
